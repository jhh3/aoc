# Intro

[Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/)

Random coding problems for me to practice new languages and keep skills sharp.

# How to run

1. Download cookies

    Install [cookies.txt](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/get-cookiestxt-locally/cclelndahbckbenkjhflpdbgdldlbecc) chrome extension.

    Download cookies file. Delete comment rows.
    Save to `~/Downloads/cookies.tx`.
    TODO: parametarize with single cookie instead of entire file.

2. Run day and part

    ```bash
    make run YEAR=2023 DAY=04 PART=1
    ```

    Or tests

    ```bash
    make test
    ```
